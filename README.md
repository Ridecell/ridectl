# Ridectl

## Overview
`ridectl` is Ridecell's internal tool that enables employees access and ways to interact with SummonPlatform instances. Employee's permissions are restricted to certain environments or features, depending on their role.

Some key features are:
1. shelling into an instance (`shell`)
2. shelling into an instance under the python environment (`pyshell`)
3. shelling into the instance's database (`dbshell`)
4. Obtaining dispatcher/support/reports account password (`password`)
5. Restart migrations for a summon instance(`restart-migrations`)
6. Create new summon-platform instance yml (`new`)

For a full list of functionalities, run `ridectl --help`
